- 👋 Hi, I’m @mtobabendev or Matt Tobaben - JoKeR 8^} I actually prefer to go by 🃏Joker🃏. What can I say, my business partner/daughter is just as bad😏. She prefers to go by Space Beth Smith (We don't really use our ~~government names~~ if we can avoid it...).

- 👀 I’m interested in learning/trying new things (how else do you know if you like/are any good at something?) & understanding how everything works. I *_LOVE_* to solve puzzles/problems!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning App Development & Website Design. Also trying my hand at Python...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that looks interesting/challenging. 🤔 Feel encouraged to run anything by me. Who knows, it may capture my attention...

- 📫 How to reach me: 📧email: *_mtobabendev@gmail.com_*, 📱phone: *_509-866-8566_* (*I prefer __text messages__ actually*😁) or my 💻website: *_www.WildCardDEV.com_*

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

- ⚡ Fun facts: I was born on January 1st ♑ (yep, totally robbed my Dad of his tax return that year... 🙄).
